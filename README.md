# IoT-Based-Health-Monitoring-System--
We are getting the patient pulse and their body temperature with ESP8266 Wi-Fi module that connects to Wi-Fi and sends the data to IoT device server. The IoT server used here is Thingspeak. Finally, the data can be monitored from any part of the world by logging into the Thingspeak channel. Dont'forget to change wi-name and wifi-password with yours. And the API key which you will get from the ThingSpeak.
